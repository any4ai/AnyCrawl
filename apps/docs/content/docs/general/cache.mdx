## Overview

AnyCrawl uses two cache layers:

- **Page Cache**: Used by `/v1/scrape` and page-level processing in `/v1/crawl`
- **Map Cache**: Used by `/v1/map` for URL discovery results

## Common Parameters

### `max_age` (ms)

- Controls cache **read** behavior.
- `0`: force refresh (skip cache read)
- `> 0`: allow cached data within that age
- omitted: use server default

### `store_in_cache`

- Applies to scrape/crawl page outputs.
- `true` (default): write cache
- `false`: skip cache write

### `use_index` (Map only)

- `true` (default): allow Map to use Page Cache index as an additional source
- `false`: disable that source

## Endpoint Behavior

### `/v1/scrape`

- Can read Page Cache before queueing a new job.
- On cache hit, response includes cache metadata (for example `cachedAt` / `maxAge`).

### `/v1/crawl`

- Currently does **not** read Page Cache for full crawl requests.
- Still supports cache-related write controls in per-page scrape options.

### `/v1/map`

- Can read Map Cache.
- Response does not include a public `fromCache` field (cache usage is internal).

## Practical Tips

- Use `max_age: 0` when you need fresh data immediately.
- Use `store_in_cache: false` for highly dynamic pages to avoid writing unstable snapshots.
- For Map, disable `use_index` if you want discovery to rely only on sitemap/search/page links.
